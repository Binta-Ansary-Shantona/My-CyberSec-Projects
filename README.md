* Title: Real-time DDoS Defense for Debian Servers 
>>>Project Description: It is an innovative DDoS mitigation system meticulously crafted for Debian-based servers. The
inspiration behind this project was the desire to utilize Snort as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and automate the
Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) process through the native features of the Ubuntu OS, making it a seamless experience for
both external and internal addresses. We have successfully developed this project to fulfil a specific client need.

>>>Scenario: I was working for a client who wanted OS-oriented simple IPS configuration without the complexity of additional hardware or systems for his webservers.
